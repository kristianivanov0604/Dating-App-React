### Node JS:
 Node JS is a packaged compilation of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript. Node JS shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over websockets. The main principle of Node JS: use non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. It replaces the traditional request-response paradigm with a fast, two-way communication model. It is asynchronous without the use of threads, it is not memory-intensive. Ideally, if you are writing a mobile app, you want to cover all the bases – iOS, Android and Windows – in order to obtain maximum market share or to grant your mobile workforce flexibility in device choice. A straightforward way to accomplish that is to write all the app’s logic in Node JS and place it on the backend. The user interface then runs on the mobile device under another language.

### Express JS:
 Express JS is server-side and mobile application framework, written in JavaScript. It builds single-page, multi-page, and hybrid mobile and web apps; Common back-end functions for web applications; APIs. Express JS is a prebuilt Node JS framework that can help you in creating server-side web applications faster and smarter. Simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, scalability are some of its characteristics and since it is made in Node JS itself, it inherited its performance as well. In short, Express JS did for Node JS what Bootstrap did for HTML/CSS and responsive web design. It made coding in Node JS a piece of cake and gave programmers some additional features to extend their server-side coding. Express JS is hands down the most famous Node JS framework - so much so that when most people talk about Node JS they surely mean Node JS + Express JS.

### MongoDB:
 MongoDB is a document-oriented database designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind. MongoDB's ability to store JavaScript objects natively saves time and processing power. Rather than storing your data in tables and rows as you would with a relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. Instead of a domain-specific language like SQL, MongoDB utilizes a simple JavaScript interface for querying. Looking up a document is as simple as passing a JavaScript object that partially describes the search target.

### JSON Web Token:
 JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.

### Cloudinary:
 It’s a comprehensive cloud-based image management solution. Seamlessly manages app's images in the cloud - image upload, cloud storage, image manipulation, image API and fast CDN. An end-to-end solution for all the image-related needs.
